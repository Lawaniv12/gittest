    <h3><font color="brown">Favorite Quotes</font></h3>  
        <p> “He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.” 
            <br>“If my mind can conceive it, and my heart can believe it — then I can achieve it.” 
            <br>“A man who views the world the same at 50 as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life.”
        </p>

<h3> <font color="brown">Summary of My Worst Day</font></h3>  
    <p>
        I think it was on the 8th November 2016 when I ran to rescue a friend who was about to be beaten
        <br>and I got the beaten of my life. I went home with a red eye, my phone stolen and the idiot who I came 
        <br>to help never saw it fit to call me the next day after he travelled the next day.

    <h3> <font color="brown">Favorite meal</font></h3>  
    <p> For me, it is Beans and plantain.
